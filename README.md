The Stuffed Burger

(speaks to smaller businesses)


Emphasize much on Inventory, one of the most prominent switching factors.




“You can get an overall perspective of how a particular territory is doing & drill down by unit … avoid problems before they happen”



<Video testimonial>


Sumo, Sushi & Bento

(speaks to multi-outlet, franchise-ready and enterprise-level buyers)


A true success story
Shows long-term reliability and value
Touches on many points that differentiates Sapaad such as device agnosticism, inventory, etc
Since the page goal is conversion, I recommend hosting the videos on Wistia. On YouTube, users might get carried away
Plus, it has advanced analytics, good for retargeting.

And other frequently asked questions:




How long does it take to switch from my current POS to Sapaad?


As little as 1 day for front-of-house. 3–4 weeks for full setup, depending on your menu.


Most restaurants are up and running with Sapaad’s POS in 1 business week or less. Sometimes, even within 24 hours, if urgent.


Back-of-house setup usually takes 3–4 business weeks. Based on the complexity.


We’ll guide you through every step.



Is the “3 months free" for annual subscription a one-time offer?

No. You can claim it every year.


You’ll get 3 months free every time you choose the annual subscription. Whether you're signing up for the first time or in your 4th year.




Can I use Sapaad on multiple devices?

Yes. Sapaad is device-agnostic. You can run it on any modern web browser, Android or iOS devices.



“In 2014, we partnered with Sapaad. It brought a world of solutions to the table. That provided us with efficiencies that we didn't have before. What we really appreciate about the system is that it's device agnostic.”
